# Task CLI

Task CLI is a simple command-line task manager written in Python that helps you create, update, delete, and manage tasks interactively or using command-line arguments. This project allows you to track tasks with different statuses (like `todo`, `in-progress`, `done`), save them to a JSON file, and list them with optional status filters.

## Features

- **Add a new task**: Add a task with a description.
- **Update a task**: Modify an existing task's description.
- **Delete a task**: Remove a task from the list.
- **Mark a task's status**: Change the status of a task to `in-progress` or `done`.
- **List tasks**: View all tasks or filter tasks by their status.
- **Interactive CLI**: Provides an interactive shell for managing tasks.
- **Command-line mode**: Allows using the tool via command-line arguments.
